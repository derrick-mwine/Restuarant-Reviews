# Project 5 - Restaurant Reviews
---

In **Restaurant Reviews** project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I took the assigned static design page that lacks accessibility and made it responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users. In this app you can choose restaurant by location and by type of cuisine.

## Usage

- Download the compressed folder with the application files.
- Unzip the folder.
- Put your Google Maps API Key in files: index.html and restaurant.html at 'YOUR-GOOGLE-MAPS-API-KEY'.
- Run in a terminal Python server.
- Open your browser on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Architecture

* [index.html] - Homepage and full listing of restaurants
* [restaurant.html]- The details of each restaurant

#### REQUIREMENTS

 - Python (Check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.).
 - JavaScript enabled browser,
